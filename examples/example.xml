<!-- MKPSXISO example XML script -->

<!-- <iso_project>
	Starts an ISO image project to build. Multiple <iso_project> elements may be
	specified within the same xml script useful for multi-disc game projects.

	<iso_project> elements must contain at least one <track> element.
	
	Attributes:
		image_name	- File name of the ISO image file to generate.
		cue_sheet	- File name of the cue sheet for the image file
					  (Optional, required if more than one track is specified, not needed
					  if you don't use CD audio in your project).
		no_xa		- If non zero, creates the image without CD-XA file attributes.
-->
<iso_project image_name="myimage.bin" cue_sheet="myimage.cue" no_xa="0">

	<!-- <track>
		Specifies a track to the ISO project. This example element creates a data
		track for storing data files and CD-XA/STR streams.
	
		Only one data track is permitted and data tracks can only be specified as the
		first track in a ISO image and cannot be specified past an audio track.
		
		Attributes:
			type		- Track type (either data or audio).
			xa_edc		- For data track only, specifies if the image has (true) or no (false) EDC in Form 2 sectors.
						  If xa_edc is not specified, defaults to 'true'.
			new_type	- For data track only, specifies if the image was created with the old(<2003) Sony's mastering tool.
						  If new_type is not specified, defaults to 'false'.
			ps2			- Optional, for data track only, specifies if the image is a Playstation 2 one. Defaults to 'false'.
			source		- For audio tracks only, specifies the file name of a wav audio file as source data for the audio track.

		<!-- <identifiers>
			Optional, Specifies the identifier strings for the data track.
			
			In order for the resulting ISO to be bootable to a PSX, the system and application identifiers must
			read PLAYSTATION. If for some reason you wanted to keep them blank, specify a blank system and
			application identifier.
			
			Attributes:
				system			- Optional, specifies the system identifier (if blank, defaults to PLAYSTATION).
				application		- Optional, specifies the application identifier (if blank, defaults to PLAYSTATION).
				volume			- Optional, specifies the volume identifier.
				volume_set		- Optional, specifies the volume set identifier.
				publisher		- Optional, specifies the publisher identifier.
				data_preparer	- Optional, specifies the data preparer identifier (defaults to a
								  message stating that the image file was generated using MKPSXISO).
				copyright       - Optional, specifies the copyright descriptor.

		<!-- <license>
			Optional, specifies the license file to use. The file format of the license file must be in
			raw 2336 byte sector format, like the ones included with the PlayStation Programmer's Tool
			SDK (also known as PsyQ SDK) in PS\CDGEN\LCNSFILE.
			
			License data is not included within the MKPSXISO program to avoid possible legal problems
			in the open source environment... Better be safe than sorry.
			
			Attributes:
				file	- Specifies the license file to inject into the ISO image.
		-->
		<license file="licensea.dat"/>
		
		<!-- <directory_tree>
			Specifies and contains the directory structure for the data track.
			
			Attributes:
				srcdir	- Optional, specifies the directory path to the source files if no source attribute is
						  specified to the <file> elements (optional, take note that it does not behave
						  like cd or chdir and must be a complete path, can be a relative or absolute path).
		-->
		<directory_tree>
		
			<!-- <file>
				Specifies a file in the directory tree.
					
				Attributes:
					name	- File name to use in the directory tree.
					source	- File name of the source file.
					type	- The file's type. Options are
								'data': for standard files.
								'mixed': for mixed mode files, i.e., 2336 bytes per sector files where each sector
										 is marked in its sub-header as either mode 2 form 1 or mode 2 form 2.
										 mkpsxiso will properly encode each sector of the file in the iso, depending on this sub-header.
										 Typical examples are XA-ADPCM  audio files (all sectors are mode 2 form 2),
										 and STR videos, i.e., MDEC/Data + XA interleaved streams (these have mixed mode 1 and mode 2 sectors).
										 'xa' and 'str' can also be used as aliases for 'mixed'.
								'da': is for CD-DA audio files. More details below.
							  If no value for type is specified, the default is 'data'.
					order	- Optional, custom directory record order for games with the 'new_type' string on 'true'. Values between 0-65535 only.
							  This setting is per directory, so you can have multiple order="0", order="11", etc but in different directories.
							  If order is not specified, defaults to '10'. So, files/folders with order < 10 will be before the unspecified ones
							  and after them the ones with order > 10. To set more than 9 files before the unspecified ones, you will need to set
							  ALL files/folders in the current directory, otherwise unexpected results will happen.
				
				Note: Either name or source attribute can be omitted. If name is only specified, it uses that
				as the name of the source file and specifying source only strips off the path name if there's
				any and uses that as the name of the file. Omitting both will cause an error obviously.

			<!-- <dir>
				Specifies a subdirectory to the directory structure. <file> and <dir> elements inside
				the element will be stored inside it.
				
				Attributes:
					name	- Specifies the name of the subdirectory.
					srcdir	- Specifies the directory path to the source files if no source attribute is
							  specified to the <file> elements (optional, can be a relative or absolute path).
					order	- Same as above, optionally specifies a custom order.

				</dir>
			
			</dir>
			
			<!-- <dummy>
				Specifies an invisible dummy file to be generated into the file system. Use this to
				add dummy sectors, usually at the end of the file system portion of the image to avoid
				the possibility of 'drive runaway' which can damage a drive mechanism.
				
				The dummy file is completely invisible as it is not added into the directory records
				of the ISO image entirely which ensures a clean directory structure when the file system is
				viewed on a file browser.
				
				Attributes:
					sectors	- Size of dummy file in sector units (1024 = 2MB).
					type	- The dummy's submode value. Values between 0-255 only.
								 '0': for a Form 1 dummy (0x00).
								'32': for a Form 2 dummy (0x20).
					ecc_addr- Boolean switch that gives the ability to calculate the ECC with the real address instead of a zeroed one.
							  This is only usefull for some CD-DA games last DATA postgap sector that has a non-standart ECC calculation.
							  Normally this should be set to 'false' or not set at all. If ecc_addr is not specified, defaults to 'false'.

			<!-- Sample DA audio file entry.
			
				DA files SHOULD be put last in the ISO file system or your ISO image may be corrupt.
				These files do not exists in the data track, but are just links to CDDA audio tracks.
				A DA file must have a trackid that matches with with a <track>. The trackid is just a
				string.
				
				You can still use <dummy> or <track> elements after this, if you want to add further audio tracks
				that are not referenced by any DA file in the data track.
