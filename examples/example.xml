<!-- MKPSXISO example XML script -->

<!-- <iso_project>
	Starts an ISO image project to build. Multiple <iso_project> elements may be
	specified within the same xml script useful for multi-disc game projects.

	<iso_project> elements must contain at least one <track> element.
	
	Attributes:
		image_name	- File name of the ISO image file to generate.
		cue_sheet	- File name of the cue sheet for the image file
					  (Optional, required if more than one track is specified, not needed
					  if you don't use CD audio in your project).
-->
<iso_project image_name="myimage.bin" cue_sheet="myimage.cue">

	<!-- <track>
		Specifies a track to the ISO project. This example element creates a data
		track for storing data files and CD-XA/STR streams.
	
		Only one data track is permitted and data tracks can only be specified as the
		first track in a ISO image and cannot be specified past an audio track.
		
		Attributes:
			type		- Track type (either data or audio).
			source		- For audio tracks only, specifies the file name of a wav audio
						  file as source data for the audio track.
			
	-->
	<track type="data">
	
		<!-- <identifiers>
			Optional, Specifies the identifier strings for the data track.
			
			In order for the resulting ISO to be bootable to a PSX, the system and application identifiers must
			read PLAYSTATION. If for some reason you wanted to keep them blank, specify a blank system and
			application identifier.
			
			Attributes:
				system			- Optional, specifies the system identifier (if blank, defaults to PLAYSTATION).
				application		- Optional, specifies the application identifier (if blank, defaults to PLAYSTATION).
				volume			- Optional, specifies the volume identifier.
				volume_set		- Optional, specifies the volume set identifier.
				publisher		- Optional, specifies the publisher identifier.
				data_preparer	- Optional, specifies the data preparer identifier (defaults to a lengthy
								  message stating that the image file was generated using MKPSXISO).
		-->

		/>
		
		<!-- <license>
			Optional, specifies the license file to use. The file format of the license file must be in
			raw 2336 byte sector format, like the ones included with the PlayStation Programmer's Tool
			SDK (also known as PsyQ SDK) in PS\CDGEN\LCNSFILE.
			
			License data is not included within the MKPSXISO program to avoid possible legal problems
			in the open source environment... Better be safe than sorry.
			
			Attributes:
				file	- Specifies the license file to inject into the ISO image.
		-->
		<license file="licensea.dat"/>
		
		<!-- <directory_tree>
			Specifies and contains the directory structure for the data track.
			
			Attributes:
				srcdir	- Optional, specifies the directory path to the source files if no source attribute is
						  specified to the <file> elements (optional, take note that it does not behave
						  like cd or chdir and must be a complete path, can be a relative or absolute path).
		-->
		<directory_tree>
		
			<!-- <file>
				Specifies a file in the directory tree.
					
				Attributes:
					name	- File name to use in the directory tree.
					type	- The file's type. Options are 'data' for standard files, 'xa' for XA
							  audio, 'str' for MDEC video streams and 'da' is for CD-DA audio files
							  (optional, defaults to data).
					source	- File name of the source file.
					
				Note: Either name or source attribute can be omitted. If name is specified, it uses the specified
				name as the name of the source file whereas specifying source strips off the path name if there's
				any and uses that as the name of the file in the image. Omitting both will cause an error.

			<!-- Stores system.txt as system.cnf -->
			<file name="system.cnf"	type="data"	source="system.txt"/>
			
			<file name="myexec.exe"	type="data"	source="myexec.exe"/>
			
			<!-- <dir>
				Specifies a subdirectory to the directory structure. <file> and <dir> elements inside
				the element will be stored inside it.
				
				Attributes:
					name	- Specifies the name of the subdirectory.
					srcdir	- Specifies the directory path to the source files if no source attribute is
							  specified to the <file> elements (optional, can be a relative or absolute path).
						  
			-->
			<dir name="mydir">
			
				<!-- All <file> and <dir> elements here will be inside mydir -->
				
				<file name="myfile.dat" type="data" source="myfile.dat"/>
				
				<!-- Specifies a directory named mystreams inside mydir -->
				<dir name="mystreams">
				
					<!-- Specifies a file as XA audio -->
					<file name="mymusic.xa" type="xa" source="mymusic.xa"/>
					<!-- Specifies a file as STR MDEC video -->
					<file name="mymovie.str" type="str" source="mymovie.str"/>

				</dir>
			
			</dir>
			
			<!-- <dummy>
				Specifies an invisible dummy file to be generated into the file system. Use this to
				add dummy sectors, usually at the end of the file system portion of the image to avoid
				the possibility of 'drive runaway' which can damage a drive mechanism.
				
				The dummy file is completely invisible as it is not added into the directory records
				of the ISO image entirely which ensures a clean directory structure when the file system is
				viewed on a file browser.
				
				Attributes:
					sectors	- Size of dummy file in sector units (1024 = 2MB).
			-->
			<dummy sectors="1024"/>
			
			<!-- Sample DA audio file entry.
			
				Unlike XA and STR file types, DA files can only be put last in the ISO file system as
				the file will be packed as raw CD audio data and you cannot put file data past a CD
				audio track. It will also be mapped as a conventional CD audio track in the CUE sheet.
				
				You can still use <track> elements after this.
			-->
			<file name="audio1.da" type="da" source="myaudio.wav"/>

	<!-- Specifies CD-DA audio tracks to the CD image
	
		WAV files must be in Microsoft format, 44100KHz 16-bit stereo, uncompressed. Mkpsxiso will not perform
		transcoding if the input file format is not correct.
		
		Plans for supporting FLAC as source audio were considered but dropped because Lameguy64 found it to
		be impossible to compile libflac under Windows and that most people usually use XA audio over CDDA anyway.
